this appp is to be used by people to assess the quality of their skin. 
They should be able to use it and then be given feedback on where they can be helped to make improvements.


It should be a lot like the garnier skin coach where it takes into account the light and the face position https://www.garnier.co.uk/skincoach-diagnosis

It should be veryy simple to get the user from uploading or taking a photo to getting feedback on their skin.

They should get feedback on what is good and how to keep it that way and what needs attention and how to do that.

We should focuas on skin wrinkles and lines.

Then  spots and blemishes also.

If there are known datasets available to use or open source apis or other available ways to drive thee app then we should use them.

The app nneeds to have super simple work flows for users and can use any tech stack whatsover.

The UI needs to be very high end and informative.

We needs pages that have clear instructions like remove glasses etc. Other tools seem to walk the person down the tool instead of being autommated like https://www.rocskincare.com/pages/roc-ai-skin-insight?srsltid=AfmBOopig-k0qQvPw2VWLKsEkQytTEAuDLNS-qZBq_AmjjxLORPFbBB_

If we can automate as much as possible thats the best.

We want to build an mvp that looks good and then iterate on top of that.
